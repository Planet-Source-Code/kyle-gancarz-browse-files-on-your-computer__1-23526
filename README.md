## Browse Files on Your Computer


</div>

### Description

This is a very simple program. It simply shows beginners how to browse through files on your computer without the comdlg32.ocx control (it gets somewhat annoying to use this control on <u>every</u> application and then having to include it in a zip file if you're sending it to your friends). It's nothing that took me a long time to do, maybe a minute, but it might be useful to someone. Oh yeah, and this only uses the standard VB controls, no additional Active X controls
